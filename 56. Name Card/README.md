# Name Card Website

## üßê About

This code is a website template that was created using the Ethereal template by HTML5 UP, with some personal touches by Farook. It includes four panels, each with its unique content. The first panel introduces the website and displays a picture of Farook. The second panel displays six icons representing various skills and interests. The third panel provides details on Farook's skills. The fourth panel is a contact form that visitors can use to get in touch with Farook.

Users can easily customize the website by adding their own preferred pictures. To do this, simply replace the existing images in the `"/static/images"` directory with your own.

To use this code, you will need to have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS. To run the website, open the `"index.html"` file in a web browser or run `server.py`.
