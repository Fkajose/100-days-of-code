# 100-Days-of-Code
 This project is a compilation of all final projects at the end of each day in Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code Python course.
 It exists as a reference for me, as well as a means to show others what I have worked on so far.

Then, it loops through all available job listings, clicks on each one, and automatically fills in the application form with the user's phone number. The application process is done by interacting with the elements on the web page using Selenium's WebDriver. If the application form is complex and requires further action, the script skips it and moves on to the next job listing. The script ends by closing the web browser after a waiting time of 10 seconds.|Selenium web automation framework, Webdriver interface of the Selenium framework,Knowledge of CSS Selectors and XPath for element locating, Understanding of basic exception handling in Python|
